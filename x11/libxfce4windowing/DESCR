libxfce4windowing is an abstraction library that attempts to present
windowing concepts (screens, toplevel windows, workspaces, etc.) in a
windowing-system-independent manner.

Currently, X11 is fully supported, via libwnck.  Wayland is partially
supported, through various Wayland protocol extensions.  However, the
full range of operations available on X11 is not available on Wayland,
due to missing features in these protocol extensions.
