clock-rs is a terminal-based clock written in Rust, designed to be a new
alternative to tty-clock.
It supports all major platforms and offers several improvements, which include:

 - The use of a single configuration file to manage its settings, with the
   ability to overwrite them through the command line,
 - Many additional features such as a timer and a stopwatch,
 - And greater flexibility as well as better user experience!
