GemFetch is a command-line system information tool written in Rust that displays
information about your operating system, software, and hardware in an aesthetic
and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of GemFetch is to be used in screenshots of your system.

The information is displayed alongside a simple ASCII art design, providing a
clean and minimalist view of your system's key details.
