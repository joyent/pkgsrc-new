XFile is a compact file manager for Unix and alike systems running X11.
It presents the file system as is, without imaginary locations,
trashcans etc. XFile uses its own file type association database written
in typical Unix/RC file syntax. Mounting support for file systems
defined in fstab, and integration with mount daemons that manage a
dedicated media directory is also included.
