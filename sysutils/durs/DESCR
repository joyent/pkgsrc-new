Durs quickly shows which directories are using the most disk space without
needing extra commands like sort or head. If there's a folder you don't have
permission to access, Durs will display just one message 'Did not have
permissions message' for it and continue scanning.

It displays the largest files or folders that can fit on your terminal screen,
going deep into the file structure to find the biggest items automatically.
This removes the need for -d or -h flags, keeping things simple. The largest
directories are highlighted with color for easy identification.

The color bars reflect both the directory structure and disk usage, with shades
of gray to show folder hierarchy. For example, if .steam is a large folder
using 44% of space, lighter gray lines from .steam show subfolders inside it.
This helps you see that deleting .steam would also remove everything inside it.
