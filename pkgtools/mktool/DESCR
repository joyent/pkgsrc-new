This is a highly-performant collection of utilities that provide
alternate implementations for parts of the pkgsrc mk infrastructure.

Many targets under pkgsrc/mk are implemented using a combination of
shell and awk, and can suffer from a lack of performance, especially
when the number of input files grows significantly.

The replacement tools provided by mktool can be anywhere from 5 times
up to 500 times faster than the defaults.

To enable, install this package or 'cargo install mktool', and then
add the following lines to your mk.conf:

	TOOLS_PLATFORM.mktool=	/path/to/mktool
	FETCH_USING=		mktool

pkgsrc will then use mktool for all targets where it is supported.
